  1. Dynmaic Programming is used for optimizing the recursion based problems.
  
  2. Two things that need to be seen while choosing Dp(Dynamic Prograamming) that are as follows:- 
      a. Overlapped SubProblems.
      b. Optimal SubStructure.
  
  3. There are two ways for the Dp that are as follows:- 
      a. Memoization
      b. Bottom-up-Approach
  
  4. In these codes we have used Bottom-up-approach.
