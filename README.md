A detailed look for the data structure and algorithms in javascript.

# Apporach of Solving Problems


   # 1. Dynamic Programming:-

        1. Dynmaic Programming is used for optimizing the recursion based problems.

        2. Two things that need to be seen while choosing Dp(Dynamic Prograamming) that are as follows:-
           a. Overlapped SubProblems.
           b. Optimal SubStructure.

        3. There are two ways for the Dp that are as follows:-
           a. Memoization
           b. Bottom-up-Approach

        4. In these codes we have used Bottom-up-approach.

   # 2. Binary Search Tree

      1. A kind of tree that follows following property:-
         a. Each node is greater than its left child.
         b. Each node is less than its right child.
      
      2. No of BST possible with 'n' keys = 2nCn / (n+1).  'Catalan Number';

      3. Complexity:-  
         a. Best Case and Average Case Complexity - O(logn)   
         b. Worst Case - O(n)
